@ApiExcludeEndpoint decorator
The @ApiExcludeEndpoint() decorator in NestJS is used to exclude an endpoint from being exposed in the autogenerated API documentation.

Some key points:

1. NestJS uses the Swagger/OpenAPI spec to generate API docs for endpoints.
2. By default, all routes/endpoints are included in the docs.
3. Using @ApiExcludeEndpoint() before a controller decorator will exclude that whole controller's endpoints from the docs.
4. Applying it before a specific method decorator like @Get() will exclude only that endpoint.
For example:

@ApiExcludeEndpoint()
@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {

  @Get()
  findAll() {} // excluded from docs

  @Post()
  create() {} // excluded

}

OR:

@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {

  @Get() 
  findAll() {}

  @ApiExcludeEndpoint()
  @Get('profile')
  getProfile() {} // excluded

}

So in summary, @ApiExcludeEndpoint allows selectively excluding certain endpoints from being exposed in the auto-generated API docs. This is useful for hiding internal or unfinished API routes.
